Feature: Saving integration form
  In order to create Magento integration channel
  As an administrator
  I need to be able to save integration form

    Given I login as administrator
    And I go to System/ Channels
    And I click "Create Channel"
    And I fill form with:
      | Name         | Magento channel |
      | Channel type | Magento         |
    And I click "Configure integration"

    And I scroll to "Integration Website"
