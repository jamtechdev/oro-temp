## Inspect with built-in Dev Tools in a Browser
The bundle adds HTML comments to the source of rendered HTML at the start and the end of Twig blocks and templates:<br/>
![HTML Comments for Inspecting Twig templates](./images/html-comments.png)

**Note:** Different line types in the comment prefix are used to distinguish the start and the end of the comment for different blocks if there are many of them on a page.

It is recommended to view generated comments in the Browser Dev Tools in the "Elements" tab of Webkit based browsers (Chrome, Safari, Opera etc.) or in the "Inspector" tab in the Firefox because comments in tabs are well formatted.

It is not recommended to use the source code view because comments there are not readable enough.

## Inspect with Symfony Web Profiler Toolbar
The bundle also comes with an extension for **Symfony Web Profiler** that helps to debug visible blocks and navigate to the source code of the templates in your IDE or browser.

The extension is disabled by default to avoid affecting page rendering. 
It uses cookies to remember is it enabled on a page reload.

### Using Twig Inspector Toolbar Extension
